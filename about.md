# About

I am a programmer by training and profession. I like writing software and building software systems. After spending many years building fairly decent algorithms and software that were predominantly heuristics-based (both in graduate school and later at work), I fell into deep learning in a project at work. It made me realize how "general" this technique is and its wide applicability across domains.

I started learning with [cs231n video lectures from Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu). Did not get far as I could not spend as much time and kept getting stuck in the basics and in building intuition. Tried other sources like http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com, which were quite good. However, nothing could bridge the gap well between theory, toy problems and practice. Then I came across the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) and it blew my mind! Jeremy Howard is a fantastic teacher and the [library](https://course.fast.ai) is super useful! I also purchased the [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527), which has been an incredible resource. 

I started this blog due to a recommendation in the book that it helps us learn better by sharing our learning. Hope readers find it as useful as I do for my learning.
