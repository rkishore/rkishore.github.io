# About

I am a programmer by training and profession. I like writing software and building software systems. After spending many years building fairly decent algorithms and software that were predominantly heuristics-based (both in graduate school and later at work), I fell into deep learning in a project at work. It made me realize how general these techniques are, its wide applicability across domains, and how they result in really clean code (something very important to me as a programmer).  

I started learning with [cs231n video lectures from Stanford](http://cs231n.stanford.edu). Did not get far as I could not spend as much time and kept getting stuck in the basics and in building intuition. Tried other sources like [this one](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), which are quite good (thanks to the author for making it publicly available). However, nothing could bridge the gap well between theory, toy problems and practical application at a high degree of performance (which was critical to get a buy-in at work where the bar is really high). Then I came across the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) and it blew my mind! Jeremy Howard is a fantastic teacher and the [library](https://course.fast.ai) is super useful! I also purchased the [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527), which has been an incredible resource. I cannot thank the fastai team enough to make their knowledge and experience with practical applications available to so many of us!

I started this blog due to a recommendation in the book that blogging helps us learn better by writing and sharing about what we learnt. Hope readers of these articles find them as useful as I do for my education.
