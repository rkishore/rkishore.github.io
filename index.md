Hello and welcome to my blog. Basically trying to capture my thoughts and learnings from fastai courses and more. Deep learning rocks!

A bit of info. about my journey into deep learning and neural nets.

I did not know anything about AI and deep learning sometime back when I was asked to dive in for a project at work. I used YOLO for object detection and did not understand much but it worked great and was a good fit for what we wanted to do. I kept getting questions about it and got tired of saying "I don't know" so I started with cs231n video lectures from Stanford. Did not get far as I just could not grasp the concepts well enough. 

Tried other sources like http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com, which was quite good but it did not connect well with what I wanted to do in practice beyond the toy examples provided.

Then I came across [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) 2019 course and it blew my mind but I could not continue beyond lecture 2 due to time constraints. Finally as I was in fastai 2019 lecture 3 in Sep. 2020, I saw that fastaiv2 and fastai 2020 course with book was out. I got the book, started the course and thank you so much @Jeremy, @sgugger and @Rachel. Best teaching of a complex subject I have seen (and I spent 8+ years in grad school).
